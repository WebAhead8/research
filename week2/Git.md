**3- How to mege between 2 branches?**

$ git merge branch1 branch2.

**what happend if we do "git merge master current-branch"?**
=> it merge between the main and the current branch, and put it into the current branch (pull the main into the current branch).

**4-different uses of git-reset?**

$ git reset HEAD^ :remove the last commit.
& git reset HEAD^^ : remove the last 2 commits.


5-Talk about and give a demo of the following commands, when would you use each one?

git stash: remove all the updating in the document.

git log :After you have created several commits, or if you have cloned a repository with an existing commit history, youâ€™ll probably want to look back to see what has happened. The most basic and powerful tool to do this is the git log command.

get fetch:The git fetch command only downloads the metadata associated with a project.
